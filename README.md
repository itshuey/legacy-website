# my-website
a website to showcase some of my projects, art, and interests!

this was my first attempt at building a website, coded in the summer of '18

if you want to check it out, just clone this repo and open the file 'index.html' in a browser!

or you can check out my current website (ver. ii) at [hueysun.com](https://itshuey.github.io/)
